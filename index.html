	        <h2>Group History</h2>
	        <p>
	            Since its establishment, Rendu Ocean has made beach cleaning activities its main project. We hope to directly reduce marine litter through beach cleaning activities, promote the hazards of marine litter, and advocate for a waste-reducing lifestyle. We believe that beach cleaning is not only a final treatment and a process of improving the appearance of the beach, but also an educational advocacy and a process of influencing volunteers and surrounding communities.<br>
	            As of the end of 2021, the project has organized a total of 3181 beach cleaning activities, mobilized nearly 125000 volunteers, and cleared over 510 tons of marine and river garbage.

	        <p>
	            In 2007, Rendu Ocean organized its first beach cleaning activity in Shanghai; In 2015, Rendu Ocean organized its first national joint beach cleaning activity. Nowadays, Rendu Ocean has explored and improved various forms of beach cleaning activities. They provide multiple channels for the public and enterprises to participate in beach cleaning, as well as suitable opportunities for parents to receive marine environmental education.<br>
	            Since September 2015, Rendu Ocean has carried out two national joint beach cleaning operations every year: the Clean Sea Campaign and the International Beach Cleanup. We have joined forces with various environmental groups across the country to clean up beach and seabed garbage and restore the clean and original appearance of the beach and seabed. Since 2019, the initiative has also supported inland partners in clearing riverbanks, thereby reducing garbage entering the sea.
